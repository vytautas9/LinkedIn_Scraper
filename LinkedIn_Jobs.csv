Oh, and we are also a B2B engineering company that builds high-tech aerial inspection systems for helicopters, airplanes and other vehicles.

Which is sometimes just an excuse to go up in the sky!

We genuinely love what we do, and it just happened so, that we've built the most awesome system in the market of this kind (for reals, no bullsh*t). Now we are selling it all around the world for geospatial companies, utilities, helicopter operators, and other businesses alike. They use it to detect defects and potential problems on critical infrastructure, such as power lines, railroads, etc.

Back-end services for running navigation routines, real-time data assessment and storage, mission status tracking, flight optimization, hardware control, etc.

Python (non-web, non-scripting): 3+ years

Компенсируем онлайн-сессии с психологом, открываем для вас и ваших детей ДМС со стоматологией и лечением от COVID-19. Организуем вакцинацию для тех, кому это важно.

Спорт и фитнес

We are now building a world-class team of engineers who think like entrepreneurs. Our engineers take pride in the challenge of their work, the quality of their peers and the impact of their product. Some recent projects delivered by our engineers include:
A JIT compiler for Excel-like formulae
Two HTAP Database engines for our custom data model
A small operating system that we are currently building and hiring for

Read the latest blogpost by our Engineering team here.

Rather than hire for a particular role or title, we are eager to speak with interested candidates, and structure roles that satisfy your aspirations and meet our rapidly changing engineering requirements. We encourage exceptional software engineers with all levels of experience to apply to Clarisights.

What do we mean by exceptional?
Excellent programming skills. We expect all our engineers at every level to code with enthusiasm.
A deep appreciation for software engineering founded in first principles. We are not looking for proficiency in specific languages or stacks. Instead, we want engineers who command a deep knowledge of the tools and languages they have worked with. And can communicate this knowledge effectively.
A hacker-mentality to building things. We hire people who are willing to pick up a problem and iterate solutions with originality and speed. And then move on to the next problem.
You take out your own trash. We are building a no-BS, low-touch, low-anxiety workplace. (This is really hard.) We like people to manage their own time, tools and projects with self-awareness and transparency. We will give you feedback regularly and then give you all the tools you need to get better at what you do. And then we will let you get on with it.
An approach to work that is collaborative, constructive and optimistic. Our engineers often work in small functional and cross-functional teams. A positive attitude to teamwork is essential.
A willingness to learn. We don't expect applicants to have exposure to marketing. Instead we are happy to hire talented engineers and teach them what they need to know.
Strong opinions held lightly. We like to work with people who feel strongly about things, but can also change their minds when they have to.

What can you expect to do?
Redesign and rebuild our codebase into a form and shape ready for the next stage of our growth.
Translate state-of-the-art software development into state-of-the-art product experiences for our users. Just like software engineers advanced from Notepad to IDEs, we want our users to leap forward from spreadsheets to responsive and interactive data workspaces.
Build, maintain and evolve systems and sub-systems that help us solve problems in power-user UIs, ETL automation, databases, and infrastructure.
Adopt and invent engineering solutions that can help Clarisights do more for our current customers, and also diversify into new business verticals.
Work closely with the Customer Success and Solutions Engineering functions to address emerging customer problems. We have fantastic customers who come up with fantastic problems.
We derive engineering inspiration and product direction from companies such as Snowflake, Notion, Grafana, Looker, Tableau and Fivetran. This means our engineers are constantly exploring, testing and building new technology. And then starting all over again.

What we offer 🌟
Ownership. You won’t be delegated tasks. You will be given ownership and accountability of outcomes and all the support you need. It is your task to figure out how to remove roadblocks and reach desired outcomes.
Learning. We are just getting started and you will have a unique vantage point on how to build a company with a very strong product and massive customer demand. You will probably learn more than you ever thought in the process. These learnings are most likely the most valuable thing we can offer. Curious people thrive at Clarisights.
Meaning. At Clarisights your work matters. It has consequences. Our engineers work on projects that are unique in vision and unsurpassed in scale. Our talent team is building a world-class team across every function. And our SSMs are more than just advocating for a product: they are changing the way companies work with data.
Wealth. We pay competitive salaries and offer generous equity. And we’re building a workplace that is low-anxiety, light-management, high-impact and collegial. We want people to do good work, with great people in a kind environment.

A JIT compiler for Excel-like formulae
Two HTAP Database engines for our custom data model

Read the latest blogpost by our Engineering team here.

Rather than hire for a particular role or title, we are eager to speak with interested candidates, and structure roles that satisfy your aspirations and meet our rapidly changing engineering requirements. We encourage exceptional software engineers with all levels of experience to apply to Clarisights.

What do we mean by exceptional?
Excellent programming skills. We expect all our engineers at every level to code with enthusiasm.
A deep appreciation for software engineering founded in first principles. We are not looking for proficiency in specific languages or stacks. Instead, we want engineers who command a deep knowledge of the tools and languages they have worked with. And can communicate this knowledge effectively.
A hacker-mentality to building things. We hire people who are willing to pick up a problem and iterate solutions with originality and speed. And then move on to the next problem.
You take out your own trash. We are building a no-BS, low-touch, low-anxiety workplace. (This is really hard.) We like people to manage their own time, tools and projects with self-awareness and transparency. We will give you feedback regularly and then give you all the tools you need to get better at what you do. And then we will let you get on with it.
An approach to work that is collaborative, constructive and optimistic. Our engineers often work in small functional and cross-functional teams. A positive attitude to teamwork is essential.
A willingness to learn. We don't expect applicants to have exposure to marketing. Instead we are happy to hire talented engineers and teach them what they need to know.
Strong opinions held lightly. We like to work with people who feel strongly about things, but can also change their minds when they have to.

What you can expect to do?
Redesign and rebuild our codebase into a form and shape ready for the next stage of our growth.
Translate state-of-the-art software development into state-of-the-art product experiences for our users. Just like software engineers advanced from Notepad to IDEs, we want our users to leap forward from spreadsheets to responsive and interactive data workspaces.
Build, maintain and evolve systems and sub-systems that help us solve problems in power-user UIs, ETL automations, databases, and infrastructure.
Adopt and invent engineering solutions that can help Clarisights do more for our current customers, and also diversify into new business verticals.
Work closely with the Customer Success and Solutions Engineering functions to address emerging customer problems. We have fantastic customers who come up with fantastic problems.
We derive engineering inspiration and product direction from companies such as Snowflake, Notion, Grafana, Looker, Tableau and Fivetran. This means our engineers are constantly exploring, testing and building new technology. And then starting all over again.

What we offer 🌟
Ownership. You won’t be delegated tasks. You will be given ownership and accountability of outcomes and all the support you need. It is your task to figure out how to remove roadblocks and reach desired outcomes.
Learning. We are just getting started and you will have a unique vantage point on how to build a company with a very strong product and massive customer demand. You will probably learn more than you ever thought in the process. These learnings are most likely the most valuable thing we can offer. Curious people thrive at Clarisights.
Meaning. At Clarisights your work matters. It has consequences. Our engineers work on projects that are unique in vision and unsurpassed in scale. Our talent team is building a world-class team across every function. And our SSMs are more than just advocating for a product: they are changing the way companies work with data.
Wealth. We pay competitive salaries and offer generous equity. And we’re building a workplace that is low-anxiety, light-management, high-impact and collegial. We want people to do good work, with great people in a kind environment.

Why Wayflyer?

Since launching in April 2020, we’ve deployed over $550m in funding across 8 countries to 1000+ eCommerce founders. In 2021 alone, the amount of funding we deployed to customers grew by 900%. We recently announced our Series B, raising $150m in funding at $ 1.6bn valuation; backed by world-leading VCs including Left Lane Capital and DST Global.

You have significant previous experience developing server-side solutions at considerable scale.
You've worked with distributed systems and have plenty of experience in server side development with a high level language, e.g. Python, Java, etc. It doesn't have to be something we use.

;3222587670;Paytrix;Backend Developer;European Union;"About the job
We are looking for a Back-End Engineer to join our early-stage FinTech!

At Paytrix, our mission is to redefine global payments for online businesses, helping them to thrive in the digital economy. Based remotely in the UK or Europe, this will be one of our first Engineering hires and the Back-End Engineer will be central to helping shape the technical platform and building a resilient, high-performing and diverse team.


WHO WE ARE

We are building the world’s first regulated payments curation layer. By consolidating best in class payments infrastructure under our ecosystem, we will enable marketplaces and eCommerce brands to scale their payments operations smoothly around the world.

We’ve just raised one of the largest pre-seed rounds in UK history from some of the world's leading FinTech focused Venture Capital firms (including the backers of Flywire, Pipe, GoCardless, Tide, Pave, and Stitch), and are supported by several well-known industry angel investors that have built multi-billion dollar businesses globally.

We are building a workplace that encourages growth, development, and fun. Working in a startup can be both rewarding and challenging, we’ll be with you throughout the highs and lows as one team.

Our goal is to make the complex - simple, messy - clean, and global scale accessible to every brand and platform. How we move money is changing at an unprecedented rate, and a digital revolution is happening now. Do you want to just watch? Or are you going to seize on the opportunity to help drive it?


THE CHALLENGE

At the intersection of fiat, crypto, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), non-traditional forms of transfer of value, and Government regulations exists a very difficult problem to solve: How to make it all work -at a global scale-, in a seamless, safe, legal, fair and private way? That’s what Paytrix has set out to address through a combination of global partnerships with tier one organisations, streamlined commercial and legal agreements, and truly progressive technology.


THE ROLE: BACK-END DEVELOPER

We are looking for a relentlessly driven and intellectually curious individual to join our back-end team. Although your primary responsibility will be to focus on the back-end logic, you are most likely a full-stack technologist who spends time writing code, driving technical discussions/decisions and actively guiding architecture, tool choices and internal technical quality. We are deploying to K8S with ArgoCD on AWS but remain somewhat cloud agnostic as we are pursuing a multi-cloud strategy.


To be successful in this role, you:

Have a broad set of expertise and experience on various technical matters and in particular with designing, developing and deploying API-first cloud-native systems.
Are familiar with the 12 Factor App methodology and may even have formulated your own additional factors!
Are highly proficient in Java (language, data structures and algorithms), Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud, and have extensively used WebFlux or other reactive frameworks, alongside the usual cloud resilience patterns.
Can co-create an environment of psychological safety that enables team members to thrive. This is very important to us, as we are a highly diverse group made up of people from many different ethnicities, religious beliefs and gender identities.
Have some experience in Payments or a FinTech business.

As part of this role you will receive the following:

Base salary between £60k and 85k / You will enjoy 25 days annual leave (plus bank holidays) / Private Medical / Pension / Company Options Scheme
We recognise that starting a new job can be intense. That’s why we give all new employees an additional week's paid leave before they join - so that you can have some downtime, and take that holiday you’ve been putting off. Whatever you want to do with that time is up to you - but it’s on us, and doesn’t come out of your annual allowance.



THE OPPORTUNITY

You will be working with a highly experienced and driven team where, alongside your day-to-day activities, you will learn the ins and outs of creating and growing a technology company.
You’ll have the opportunity to make important technical decisions and shape the future of the platform, business, and payments.
You will work with “state of the art” but not “bleeding edge” technologies and will have a clear path to influence decisions and outcomes.
You will be working remotely, but getting together IRL at regular intervals to establish personal and meaningful relationships with your team and the rest of the company.


THE PROCESS

We know interviews can be laborious. To keep the process as streamlined as possible, we’ve split it into 3 stages, and we will keep you informed of your progress at each stage:
Initial interview: (60 minutes)
Technical assessment, This stage typically takes two hours (60 min to design a hypothetical system / 60 min to code a PoC)
Call with Founders
Offer, where we will explain the compensation package, long-term incentive program and ancillary benefits. This stage usually takes less than an hour.

It will allow users to focus on the things that are important and give an idea of where this precious currency called time is being spent. You may think of it as a time management assistant, that allows you to focus on goals, helps understand where time is spent, detects trends and patterns in your behaviour, provides a holistic view of your life, and help you be appreciative of what you have.

Develop cross-platform applications from scratch

We will not let you become obsolete. But whatever you do - give it your best.
Pitch your ideas about anything. We build startups! Let’s build yours together.
Work hard, play hard. Adrenaline junkie or zen. Or a casual all-nighter in the city.
Take time off. Even if you don't - still do. Don’t feel bad about taking a day with a same-day notice. We have all been there. Just be respectful of your responsibilities and to your team.
Additional health insurance. Take care of yourself. It just makes sense.

In the last 10 years, Mambu has been revolutionising banking - making it more accessible, more straightforward and more inclusive for everyone. With fresh funding secured and a near €5 billion valuation we have huge ambitions for ourselves and the whole banking sector.

We bring this same sense of innovation and aspiration to how we support our people. We pioneered the 4 day summer work week, have announced the provision of equity for all and launched Our Mambu Deal to capture how we work with each other and what we offer all Mambuvians.

These are just the beginning. We’ll continue to look for ways to make Mambu an even better place to work.

We’re not here to play it safe.

We’re here to change the world.

Meet your team

We are the Release Team, a specialised DevOps slash Continuous Delivery team. Our mission is to create and maintain a reliable self-service platform to release Mambu SaaS software without downtime and in a reliable way. Our tooling is based on ArgoCD and Kubernetes. We think and breathe Cloud native, Agile, GitOps and especially Continuous Delivery.

Recently we have started our journey of multi-cloud offering, our platform needs to be able to ship our code to all the major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure). Our team is composed of very experienced SRE’s that span their experience from 10 to 20 years, so you will be well surrounded.

Mambu is growing rapidly and the team is all about engineering highly scalable and maintainable solutions to have a direct impact on the developer and customer experience. It is a multinational, multi-location, remote first team, where ideation AND execution are both valued, sustainable solutions using cutting edge technologies are encouraged.

What You’ll Do

Your day

A typical day starts with a standup, where you synchronise with the team. Tell them what you worked on, what was cool during the day and what could have gone better.

Then you will dive into some tasks you have planned to tackle for the day. It can be a small task like guiding a developer to unblock a ArgoCD deployment or something clogging in a GitLab pipeline. It could also be a bigger project like redesigning how we autoscale ArgoCD or how we create and manage K8s clusters.

Meetings (sadly) do still happen, and you will be asked to take part from time to time, but we strive (and succeed) to keep them on topic and useful. We are all about feedback and you can always count on the team as well as the management to lend you any assistance or guidance needed – the same will be expected from you though. Finally, the day after you are ready to merge to master. You will deploy everything up to prod so that code and deployment are aligned with Infrastructure as code.

During regular (non-obligatory) guild meetings you can show off your latest state-of-the-art tools and processes you worked on or voice your opinion on things others did.

Every 5-6 weeks you will be a guardian that helps out to facilitate the release process. You will interact with other SRE and engineers outside of the team to diagnose incidents and help out with the release process.

Your mission
Ensure that the release platform is highly available, performs consistently and that the infrastructure can scale automatically without any downtime for the customer by making use of the latest tools and technologies
Make sure our systems are regularly updated (with Infrastructure as code) and that they are hardened on the security side of things
Help development teams autonomously make use of the platform to deliver product features at a higher pace, with reduced coordination, using automation wherever possible
Share knowledge and best practices (like Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment) to the team and organisation to improve delivery, ensure accessibility and improve all aspects of the release platform.
What You’ll Bring

Your experience includes:
Solid knowledge of at least one public cloud provider
Extensive experience with continuous deployments with various deployment strategies (blue/green, canary, etc)
Extensive experience with continuous integration practices
Good experience with the continuous delivery methodology
Good understanding about containers, container orchestration and the ecosystem around them
Experience managing Kubernetes clusters and debugging applications running on them.
Knowledge of process management and monitoring
Software development building and testing skills (Java, Python, Go, or others)
Strong communication, organisational and problem-solving skills
Understanding of CI systems
Experienced in Infrastructure as code
Good understanding of deployment strategies and tools used for Kubernetes, including Helm, Kustomize and the GitOps approach
Fluent in English
Understanding of cloud native applications and distributed systems
Experience with configuration management
Application security knowledge (secure software development practices)
Experience with on-call rotation and incident handling
Gitlab, Snyk, ArgoCD, K8s, Terraform
Mambu’s future

We are a diverse group of Mambuvians, and we are growing fast. Our eyes are on the future, and we believe we can use our technology and our talent to deliver banking experiences for billions that are also sustainable and inclusive and accessible.

Your future

We’re also focused on delivering a fantastic working experience for all Mambuvians. We pioneered the 4 day working week between June - August many years ago, and continue to innovate around how work should feel and how it should get done. Our Mambu Deal is how we articulate this relationship of support and dedication which drives us all forward.

Review code produced by your teammates or external contributors and provide suggestions which increase code quality, reduce errors and make the code more understandable.
Try new changes done by colleagues, report bugs, suggest improvements.

It will help if you:

Have hands-on experience with VMware's vSphere and Cloud Director.
Are used to containers and open-source virtualization solutions.

Vinted is Europe’s biggest pre-loved fashion marketplace, with 65+ million members in 16 countries. We want to make second-hand the first choice worldwide.

A team of 1,200+ people from Vinted’s offices in Vilnius, Berlin, Prague, and Amsterdam develop and support our platform. We share a unique work culture that’s based on aiming high, taking ownership, co-creating, caring, and growth.

Vinted is committed to building an inclusive workplace where people from all walks of life feel a sense of belonging. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, colour, national origin, citizenship, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion/beliefs, disability or age. We truly believe when we can be fully ourselves, we work better.

We work in cross-functional product teams (10-12 people), and groups of those teams form domains (3-5 teams). Usually our teams have a PM, analyst, designer, mobile platform developers (iOS, Android), web developers, and two or three backend software engineers. And those teams work in isolation as much as possible. Or at least we have hope for a while. However, due to our rapid growth we have grown into a place where we have cross-team challenges at backend - maybe it’s you who could help us?

In the Transactional Experience (TX) domain we focus on providing seamless and hassle-free checkout experience while maintaining strong data consistency guarantees, ensuring resilient payment & shipping orchestration and maintaining best in class performance. In a nutshell, we want to ensure that every transaction that can succeed, succeeds. On top of product-related challenges, we will not shy away from acknowledging that our rapid product growth has left us with some challenging technical riddles. Solving those by splitting up monolithic chunks into smaller modularized pieces in our codebase is one of the key challenges you would be working on in enabling our code to catch up with our product.

In This Position, You’ll
Lead/define technical initiatives that spans across multiple teams within TX
Shape our product features for them to meet both: our code quality standard and high demands from our members
Work closely with the domain’s Staff Engineer to enable the architectural evolution of our codebase
Improve our tech stack by being the voice of reason, when we are in extremes: be it creating too much technical debt, be it gold-plating
Be inspiring example to younger engineers in our domain and outside it
More Details About Your Daily
We try to be agile as much as we can. Sometimes we succeed, sometimes we learn
Lean software development is something we strive for
Strong code review culture
We write unit tests (RSpec) for all of the code that makes sense. And we have >10000 tests which run in ~5 minutes through our Jenkins setup
See your code affect 65+ million users almost instantly. Our master branch gets rolled out straight to production on each merge. We deploy many times per day.
Work with Ruby on Rails, MySQL, Memcached, Elasticsearch and many more technologies. We don't expect you to be familiar with any of them beforehand
We monitor our code through Kibana, Grafana, Datadog and new tools that you will introduce :)
About You
Have experience of working as an architect, tech-lead, who previously led cross team technical initiatives
Know a thing or two about breaking down large monoliths into smaller, manageable components and services
Love to fix things, and more importantly - understand how they work
Love to help others grow by showing example
You are willing to take on new challenges and constantly grow as a person
Work Perks
Opportunity to join our share options programme
Learning budget (13.2 % from net yearly salary)
25 working days of holiday
Remote workout classes
Mental- and emotional-health support from Mindletic
Private health insurance
A canteen that serves homemade food at friendly prices
Monthly team-building events
A personal budget for shopping on Vinted
Work anywhere in the EU for 90 days out of the year
Dog-friendly office
Home office support (IT workstation equipment provided + a personal budget of up to 540 € for home workplace furniture)
We want people to work from where they’re most comfortable, which is why we’re using a hybrid workplace model at Vinted for the foreseeable future.

Hybrid means that we encourage working from the office on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and the remainder of your time from either home or the office, but it’s not required. You’re welcome to work from either location all or some of the time, depending on what you think is best and safest for you, and how the Covid-19 situation is developing where you are.

The salary range for this position is 6975 – 8370 € (gross) per month.

Our journals span science, health, humanities and social sciences, engineering, and sustainability. And we continue to expand into new academic disciplines so more researchers can publish open access.

The Role

To empower scientists and radically improve how science is published, evaluated and disseminated to researchers, innovators and the public, we have built our own state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence Review Assistant (AIRA). Data is at the heart of AIRA in the form of AIRA Knowledge – a rich graph of academic knowledge such as scientific publications, citation relationships between those publications, as well as authors, institutions and fields of research. This serves as the basis of all the AI/ML models used by our reviewer recommendation service and our quality checks.

Additionally, we have created a Cloud Data Warehouse, that allows integrating information coming from our editorial platform and external sources from the publishing industry to calculate real-time insights and feed cutting-edge machine learning algorithms.

We are now looking for a passionate Senior Data Engineer / Data Architect to join our growing team and help us evolve AIRA Knowledge and our Cloud Data Warehouse.

The ideal candidate is an experienced data pipeline builder and data wrangler who enjoys optimising existing data systems or building them from the ground up.

Expertise in data processing
Ability to prioritise
Familiarity with Agile framework
Good English skills

Nice to have

Understand the functional requirements for defining the best data models and data flows between our applications, services, data storage and synchronization mechanisms
Integrate, transform, and consolidate data from various structured and unstructured data systems into structures that are suitable for building analytics solutions
Support the different SW development teams in the modelling, design, construction, evolution, and decommission of their data-intensive applications and data models
Understand and promote the best Data frameworks and solutions, technical standards and key technologies, to effectively support existing and future business requirements
Collaborate closely with Machine Learning and Data Science Team to improve the performance of our ML pipelines

Benefits

With more than 50 nationalities represented in our global team, you will work regularly with teammates in other countries, and with our community of researchers, editors, and authors from around the globe.

Our mission to create solutions for healthy lives also extends to the working environment we provide for our employees.

This includes:

100% remote working

Employees now have the flexibility to choose where they want to work, with remote working available on a part- or full-time basis (not applicable to some Workplace/IT jobs due to nature of role requiring presence onsite, in the office).

Singularity XDR ingests data and leverages our patented AI models to deliver autonomous protection.

We're looking for people that will drive team success and collaboration across SentinelOne. If you’re enthusiastic about innovative approaches to problem-solving, we would love to speak with you about joining our team!

What are we looking for?

We're looking for an exceptional security researcher to join the SentinelLabs team with in-depth knowledge of threat intelligence and malware analysis, specializing on APTs or cybercrime, and able to speak to the security landscape as a whole. You will produce research that provides value for defenders and security teams. You will also be representing SentinelOne at events and conferences. You will support the growing PR needs by commenting and responding quickly to cybersecurity events in the media.

Even though our job description may seem like we're looking for a specific candidate with a lot of diverse skills, the role will inevitably be tailored to the person who applies and joins. Regardless of how well you feel you fit our description, we encourage you to apply if you meet a cross-section of these criteria:

What skills and knowledge should you bring?

Collaborate with the strategy, planning, and execution of the SentinelLabs publications. This would include your standalone research, peer research reviews and optimization, and competitive analysis.
Produce top-quality research that can meet global media's needs around APT, cybercrime, and cybersecurity, independently or based on the SentinelOne internal data.
Represent SentinelOne/SentinelLabs in cybersecurity conferences like Blackhat, RSA, and other cybersecurity conferences, including smaller venues like B-sides or private events.
Actively participate in the give-and-take of internal research, providing advice and leads and supporting other team members.

Zapier Code of Conduct

Diversity and Inclusivity at Zapier

Zapier is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace dedicated to pursuing and hiring a diverse workforce.

About You

You are a skilled written communicator. Zapier is a 100% remote team and writing is our primary means of communication. You can communicate about technical topics without unnecessary jargon. You translate unfamiliar data modeling concepts into approachable ones to team mates and stakeholders with less experience working with data.

You have experience in SQL. You’ve used written complex SQL queries that join across data from multiple systems, matching them up even when there was not a straightforward way to join the tables. You've designed tables with an eye towards ease of use, high performance and with focus on the consumer of the data. You've documented schemas and created data dictionaries.

You appreciate our team’s values of eagerness to collaborate with diverse teammates from any function of the organization or with any level of data knowledge, iterating over your deliverables, and being curious.

You strive to learn about business and product goals so you can design data models that empower analysis and reporting. You value partnering with your Data Science colleagues to ensure your efforts align with data objectives.

You have experience with data modeling: you understand data warehouse modeling and have a nuanced appreciation for when and where traditional approaches work and when they don’t. You have experience developing ETL pipelines to support business data needs.

You understand that the perfect is the enemy of the good, and default to action by shipping MVP code and iterating as needed to get towards better solutions.

Things You’ll Do
Develop ETL/ELT pipelines to ingest and transform data from upstream databases and APIs into a data warehouse. Our stack includes AWS Redshift, Matillion ETL, Astronomer/Airflow, Kafka, NiFi and custom Python.
Data modeling, including designing and expanding slowly changing dimension and fact tables.
Build reports and dashboards in data visualization tools. We use Looker.
Work with product teams and help them surface interesting data back in the product for our users and partners to see.
Influence design of our product’s data model.
As a part of Zapier's all-hands philosophy, help customers via support (or other mechanisms) to ensure they have the best experience possible.
About Data Insights At Zapier

We are a collaborative team of Data Scientists and Data Warehouse Engineers influencing Zapier to deliver the best possible experience to users, customers and partners.

On the Data Science side, our responsibilities include proactive and request-driven analysis; ideation, design and analysis of experiments; quantitative research (i.e. data mining & machine learning); metrics definition, reporting and goal setting for teams; insights discovery (i.e. hosting a searchable repository); instrumentation (i.e. event design); and administering data literacy and data self-serve platforms (we use Looker) to Zapier.

On the Data Warehouse Engineering side, our responsibilities include building scalable data models and ELT / ETL pipelines, insights tooling (i.e. developing tools to accelerate or improve the quality of analysis / data structures); work with our stakeholders to design data that feeds back into Zapier products; and influencing the data architecture of product teams.

We collaborate with Data Foundations, which builds and maintains a platform of capabilities for tooling, frameworks and infrastructure.

Curious about our stack? We use AWS Redshift (and the related AWS products AWS Glue, Redshift Spectrum, AWS S3), Looker, Airflow, Matillion ETL, Kafka, Python, NiFi and dbt.

A better internet, where privacy is the default, is possible. Building this better internet might seem daunting or even unthinkable, but at Proton, this is what we do every day.

We believe in a world where growth thrives across borders and cultures. That’s why our Founder and CEO Rick Hammell started Atlas, coining the term Employer of Record (EOR) simultaneously. As an EOR, Atlas employs people to work for companies anywhere in the world. Before we came along, the only businesses offering a similar solution were essentially brokers. They’d outsource your HR and payroll services to third-party providers in different countries. Today, we’re the only 100% Direct EOR in the world, partnering with clients to get to market 82% faster, at a reduced cost, and with lower risk through local expertise in over 160 countries.

Atlas technology powers the idea that companies can employ whoever they want, wherever they are in the world. Through our cloud-based platform, we deliver the Human Resources infrastructure that underpins international growth, leaving companies free to focus on the strategy that makes it happen. We partner with our clients through their international life cycle from the first dip in the global pool until the moment it’s time to set up their own entities and run payroll. Atlas is here from point A to point Z.

The future of work is borderless, and so are we. So, it helps that our people are located around the globe — in the US, UK, India, China and beyond — and speak 90+ languages. Diversity and inclusion are at our core.
